# Project 6

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project was to create a Shape class with two children classes - Rectangle and triangle. With those classes created, there were several perimeter and area array methods created to call each class. Each method was called, and the block of code created was able to output each class. 

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- classes
- array methods
- non-web Server Node.js
```
## What I learned:
This project continued our work on classes, as well as introducing class inheritance - parent and children classes. It also provided an opportunity to use a generic block of code to process data.
